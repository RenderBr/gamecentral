# DiscordJS and MySQL
In this repository I will show you a quick example of how to use MySQL in your DiscordJS bot. Before you take a look into this repository and don't know how MySQL works, please visit first my other repository where I show how MySQL and NodeJS works: [NodeJS-MySQL](https://github.com/HalloSouf/NodeJS-MySQL)

Before you asking around and ask yourself questions, pay attention to the following things:
* You have basic understanding of Javascript
* You know the DiscordJS library a little bit
* You have some understanding of SQL queries [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
* You know how a MySQL database works

## Packages
For using MySQL in your NodeJS application, you will need the **mysql**-package and the **discord.js**-package. You can download these packages with:
> npm install mysql

**Documentation:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql

> npm install discord.js

**Documentation:** https://discord.js.org

## MySQL Database
Here is a look how I designed my `settings`-table in my Database:
